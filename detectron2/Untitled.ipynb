    "Review of the Medium article: [Splash of Color: Instance Segmentation with Mask R-CNN and TensorFlow](https://engineering.matterport.com/splash-of-color-instance-segmentation-with-mask-r-cnn-and-tensorflow-7c761e238b46)\n",
    "***\n",
    "Two important topics reviewed in this article:\n",
    "1. Overview of Mask RCNN\n",
    "2. How to train a model from scratch and use it to build  a smart color splash filter.\n",

    "## Instance Segmentation ##\n",
    "\"It is the task of identifying object outlines at the pixel level.\"\n",
    "- __It is identified as one of the hardest possible vision tasks__\n",
    "A brief overview: \n",
    "- Classification: Identifying what's the main context of the image.\n",
    "- Semantic segmentation: Clearly specifying what we are identifying in the image and focussing on it.\n",
    "- Object detection: Identifying the number of locations this context is present in this image.\n",
    "- Instance segmentation: Highlighting the context and pixels that belong to it. \n",

    "## Mask R-CNN ##\n",
    "\n",
    "It stands for regional convolutional neural network. \n",
    "- Two stage framework:\n",
    "    + the first stage scans the image and generates proposals (areas likely to contain an object)\n",
    "    + second stage classifies the proposals and generates boxes and masks.\n",
    "    \n",
    "This was introduced in 2018, as an extension to the predecessor, Faster-R-CNN.\n",
    "- Faster-R-CNN is a popular framework for object detection.\n",
    "- __Mask-R-CNN__ extends it with instance segmentation, and other things.\n",

    "### Training Dataset\n",
    "1. Initial approach should always be searching for public datasets that contain the objects we need. \n",
    "2. Based off this article, we can have a smaller dataset if we rely on two main points:\n",
    "    - Transfer learning: instead of training a model from scratch, we start with a weights file thats been trained on the COCO dataset. This dataset may not have the object we want, but its early learned a lot of the features common in natural images, which really helps.\n",
    "    - To begin with, we are not setting a high accuracy, so this is a good start!\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Annotation Tools:\n",
    "1. VGG Image Annotator (VIA): Fast, light - prefererred to be used.\n",
    "2. LabelMe\n",
    "3. RectLabel: works only on Mac.\n",
    "4. LabelBox\n",
